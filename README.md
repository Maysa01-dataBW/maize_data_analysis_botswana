# Maize Production Trends in Botswana (2016â€“2023)

## Project Summary
This project analyzes year-over-year trends in **maize production**, **area harvested**, and **yield** in Botswana from **2016 to 2023**. Using visualizations and exploratory analysis, the goal is to uncover patterns, identify top-performing years, and offer practical recommendations for sustainable improvement.

## Business Challenge 
Farmers have a difficulty in optimizing crop yields and improving profitability due to lack of insights into soil conditions and historical data.

##  Project Objectives
- Analyze trends in maize **production, yield, and area harvested**.
- Identify the **best and worst-performing years** and investigate potential causes.
- Provide **data-driven recommendations** to improve productivity and sustainability.

##  Tools & Methodology
- **Tools Used**: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Google Spreadsheets 
- **Data Sources**: Ministry of Agriculture (Botswana), summarized dataset (2016â€“2023)
- **Approach**: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Time-Series Visualization

## ðŸ“Š Key Insights

### 1. Highest Production Year: **2021**
- Maize production peaked at **339,648 tonnes**.
- Achieved with **174,704 ha** of cultivated land.
- Likely driven by favorable weather and increased inputs.

### 2. Lowest Yield Year: **2017**
- Yield dropped to **317,558 kg/ha** â€” the lowest in the dataset.
- Despite harvesting only **55,467 ha**, productivity was weak, likely due to drought or poor resource distribution.

### 3. Highest Yield Year: **2023**
- Yield reached **789,401 kg/ha** â€” the highest across the 8-year span.
- Production wasn't the highest, but land use was highly efficient.

### 4. Fluctuating Area Harvested
- Significant shifts in land use affected total production:
  - **2020**: 293,014 ha
  - **2022**: 158,879 ha

##  Recommendations
Farmers are advised to;
- Use **climate-resilient seeds and smart irrigation** to stabilize yield.
- Promote consistent land cultivation through **government incentives**.
- Study and replicate **2023's best practices** to scale productivity.
- Improve **data infrastructure** to allow near real-time monitoring and decision-making.
